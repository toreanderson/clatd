=head1 NAME

B<clatd> - a CLAT / SIIT-DC Edge Relay implementation for Linux

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<clatd> implements the CLAT component of the 464XLAT network architecture
specified in I<RFC 6877>. It allows an IPv6-only host to have IPv4 connectivity
that is translated to IPv6 before being routed to an upstream PLAT (which is
typically a Stateful NAT64 operated by the ISP) and there translated back to
IPv4 before being routed to the IPv4 internet. This is especially useful when
local applications on the host requires actual IPv4 connectivity or cannot
make use of DNS64 (for example because they use legacy AF_INET socket calls,
or if they are simply not using DNS64).

B<clatd> may also be used to implement an SIIT-DC Edge Relay as described in
I<I-D.ietf-v6ops-siit-dc-2xlat>. In this scenario, the PLAT is in reality a
SIIT-DC Border Relay (see I<I-D.ietf-v6ops-siit-dc>) instead of a Stateful
NAT64 (see I<RFC6146>). When used as a SIIT-DC Edge Relay, you will probably
want to manually configure the settings I<clat-v4-addr>, I<clat-v6-addr>, and
I<plat-prefix> to mirror the SIIT-DC Border Relay's configuration.

It relies on the software package TAYGA by Nathan Lutchansky for the actual
translation of packets between IPv4 and IPv6 (I<RFC 6145>) TAYGA may be
downloaded from its home page at L<http://www.litech.org/tayga/>.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<clatd> [options]

=head1 OPTIONS

=over

=item -q

Quiet mode; suppress normal output. This is the same as setting B<quiet=1>.
Warnings and errors are still outputted, to silence those too, repeat I<-q>.

=item -d

Enable debugging output. This is the same as setting B<debug=1>. Repeat for
even more debugging output, which is the
equivalent of setting B<debug=2>.

=item -c conf-file

Read configuration settings from B<conf-file>. See section B<CONFIGURATION>
below for more info.

=item -h, --help

Print a brief usage help and exit.

=item key=value

Set configuration B<key> to I<value>, overriding any setting found in the
configuration file. Refer to the section B<CONFIGURATION> below for more info.

=back

=head1 INVOCATION

B<clatd> is meant to be run under a daemonising control process such as
systemd, upstart, or similar. It is further meant to be (re)started whenever a
network interface goes up/down as this might mean a change in the PLAT
availability or which prefixes/addresses needs to be used for the CLAT to work.
It may also be run directly from the command line. It will run until killed
with SIGINT (^C) or SIGTERM, at which point it will clean up after itself and
exit gracefully.

See the I<scripts/> directory in the source distribution for some examples on
how to invoke it it.

=head1 INSTALLATION

The following commands will quickly download and install the latest version
of B<clatd> and its dependencies:

=over

=item git clone https://github.com/toreanderson/clatd

=item sudo make -C clatd install installdeps

=back

This will install B<clatd> to /usr/sbin, plus install systemd, upstart, and/or
NetworkManager scripts if your distribution appears to be using them, and
install all the dependencies. Note that TAYGA isn't available in RPM format,
so on RedHat/Fedora the installdeps target will install gcc and attempt to
compile TAYGA from source.

=head1 CONFIGURATION

B<clatd> is designed to be able to run without any user-supplied configuration
in most cases. However, user-specified onfiguration settings may be added to
the configuration file, the path to which may be given on the command line
using the I<-c> option, or if it is not, the default location
I</etc/clatd.conf> is used. Configuration settings may also be given directly
on the command line when starting B<clatd>, which takes precedence over settings
in the configuration file.

Settings are of the form B<key=value>. A list of recogniced keys and their
possible values follow below:

=over

=item B<quiet=integer> (default: I<0>)

Set this to 1 to suppress normal output from B<clatd>. This is the same as
providing the command line option I<-q>. Set it to 2 to additionally
suppress warnings and errors. Note that this does not suppress debugging
output.

=item B<debug=integer> (default: I<0>)

Set this to 1 to get debugging output from B<clatd>, or 2 to get even more of
the stuff. These are the equivalent of providing the command line option I<-d>
the specified number of times.

=item B<clat-dev=string> (default: I<clat>)

The name of the network device used by the CLAT. There should be no reason to
change the default, unless you plan on running multiple instances of B<clatd>
simultaneously.

=item B<clat-v4-addr=ipv4-address> (default: I<192.0.0.1>)

The IPv4 address that will be assigned to the CLAT device. Local applications
will bind to this address when communicating with external IPv4 destinations.
In a standard 464XLAT environment with a stateful NAT64 serving as the PLAT,
there should be no need to change the default.

When using B<clatd> as an SIIT-DC Edge Relay (I<I-D.ietf-v6ops-siit-dc-2xlat>),
you will want to set this to the IPv4 Service Address configured in the SIIT-DC
Border Relay. This way, local applications can correctly identify which public
address they'll be using on the IPv4 internet, and will be able to provide
fully functional references to it in application-level payload, and so on.

The default address is one from I<RFC 7335>.

=item B<clat-v6-addr=ipv6-address> (default: auto-generated)

The IPv6 address of the CLAT. Traffic to/from the B<clat-v4-addr> will be
translated into this address. When using B<clatd> as an SIIT-DC Edge Relay, you
will want to set this to the same IPv6 address in the Explicit Address Mapping
configured in the SIIT-DC Border Relay.

By default, B<clatd> will attempt to figure out which network device will be
used for traffic towards the PLAT, see if there is any SLAAC-based globally
scoped addresses on it (i.e., a /64 with '0xfffe' in the middle of the
Interface ID), and will if so substitute that '0xfffe' value with '0xc1a7'
("clat") to generate a CLAT IPv6 address.

If only a non-SLAAC global address is found on the PLAT-facing device,
B<clatd> will substitute its Interface ID with a random integer and use the
result as the CLAT IPv6 address. It will only do so if the prefix length is
/120 or smaller, as otherwise the risk of IID collisions is considered to be
too high. Note that on most Perl platforms, the I<rand()> function is limited
to 48 bits, which means that for longer IIDs, the least significant bits will
be all 0.

If multiple addresses are found in either category, the one that shares the
longest common prefix with the PLAT prefix will be preferred when deriving
the CLAT IPv6 address according to the algorithm described above.

=item B<dns64-servers=srv1,[srv2,..]> (default: use system resolver)

Comma-separated list of DNS64 servers to use when discovering the PLAT prefix
using the method described in RFC 7050. By default, the system resolver is
used, but it might be useful to override this in case your ISP doesn't provide
you with a DNS64-enabled name server, and you want to test B<clatd> using any of
the public DNS64/NAT64 instances on the internet. The first PLAT prefix
encountered will be used.

=item B<cmd-ip=path> (default: assume in $PATH)

Path to the B<ip> binary from the iproute2 package available at
L<https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/net/iproute2>. Required.

=item B<cmd-ip6tables=path> (default: assume in $PATH)

Path to the B<ip6tables> binary from the netfilter package available at
L<http://netfilter.org>. Only required for adding ip6tables rules
(see the B<ip6tables-enable> configuration setting).

=item B<cmd-tayga=path> (default: assume in $PATH)

Path to the B<tayga> binary from the TAYGA package available at
L<http://www.litech.org/tayga>. Required.

=item B<forwarding-enable=bool> (default: I<yes>)

Controls whether or not B<clatd> should enable IPv6 forwarding if necessary.
IPv6 forwarding is necessary for B<clatd> to work correctly. It will also
ensure that the I<accept_ra> sysctl is to '2' for all devices have it set to
'1', in order to prevent any connectivity loss as a result of enabling
forwarding.

All sysctls that are modified will be restored to their original values when
B<clatd> is shutting down.

=item B<ip6tables-enable=bool> (default: see below)

Controls whether or not B<clatd> should insert ip6tables rules that permit the
forwarding of IPv6 traffic between the CLAT and PLAT devices. Such forwarding
must be permitted for B<clatd> to work correctly. Any rules added will be
removed when B<clatd> is shutting down.

The default is I<yes> if the ip6tables_filter kernel module is loaded, I<no>
if it is not.

=item B<plat-dev> (default: auto-detect)

Which network device is facing the PLAT (NAT64). By default, this is
auto-detected by performing a route table lookup towards the PLAT prefix.
This setting is used when setting up generating the CLAT IPv6 address, and
when setting up ip6tables rules and Proxy-ND entries.

=item B<plat-prefix> (default: auto-detect)

The IPv6 translation prefix into which the PLAT maps the IPv4 internet. See
I<RFC 6052> for a closer description. By default, this is auto-detected from
DNS64 answers using the method in I<RFC 7050>.

=item B<proxynd-enable> (default: I<yes>)

Controls whether or not B<clatd> should add a Proxy-ND entry for the CLAT IPv6
address on the network device facing the PLAT. This is probably necessary
on Ethernet networks (otherwise the upstream IPv6 router won't know where to
send packets to the CLAT's IPv6 adderss), but likely not necessary on
point-to-point links like PPP or 3GPP mobile broadband, as in those cases
IPv6 ND isn't used. However it doesn't hurt to add Proxy-ND entries in that
case, either.

Any entries added wil be removed when B<clatd> is shutting down.

=item B<tayga-conffile> (default: use a temporary file)

Where to write the TAYGA configuration file. By default, a temporary file will
be created (and also deleted when B<clatd> is shutting down), but you may also
specify an explicit configuration file here, which will not be deleted on
shutdown.

=item B<tayga-v4-addr> (default: I<192.0.0.2>)

The IPv4 address assigned to the TAYGA process. This is used for emitting
ICMPv4 errors back to the host (i.e., it will show up as the first hop when
tracerouting to IPv4 destinations), and you may also ping it to verify that
the TAYGA process is still alive and well.

The default address is one from I<RFC 7335>.

=item B<v4-conncheck-enable=bool> (default: I<yes>)

Whether or not to check if the system has IPv4 connectivity before starting
the CLAT. If it does, then B<clatd> will simply exit without doing anything.
This is meant so that you can always enable B<clatd> to the system startup
scripts or network-up event scripts (such as NetworkManager's dispatcher
scripts), but not have B<clatd> interfering with native IPv4 connectivity when
this is present.

If you want to always start the CLAT whenever possible, even though the
system has IPv4 connectivity, disable this setting. You may instead use the
B<v4-defaultroute-enable> and B<v4-defaultroute-metric> settings to prevent
B<clatd> from interfering with native IPv4 connectivity.

=item B<v4-conncheck-delay=seconds> (default: I<10>)

When performing an IPv4 connectivity check, wait this number of seconds
before actually doing anything. This is to avoid a race condition where for
example IPv6 SLAAC finshes and triggers a network-up event script to start
B<clatd>, while IPv4 DHCPv4 is still running in the background. This is at
least a likely scenario when using NetworkManager, as it will start the
dispatcher scripts as soon as either IPv4 or IPv6 has completed, and
IPv6 SLAAC is typically faster than IPv4 DHCPv4.

Set it to 0 to perform the check immediately.

=item B<v4-defaultroute-enable=bool> (default: I<yes>)

Whether or not to add an IPv4 default route pointing to the CLAT. In a
typical 464XLAT environment, you want this. However when using B<clatd> in
an environment where native IPv4 connectivity is also present, you might want
to disable this and instead control manually which IPv4 destinations is
reached through the CLAT and which are not.

=item B<v4-defaultroute-metric=integer> (default: I<2048>)

The metric of the IPv4 default route pointing to the CLAT. The default is
chosen because it is higher than that of a native IPv4 default route added by
NetworkManager, which makes it so that the native IPv4 connectivity is
preferred if present.

=item B<v4-defaultroute-mtu=integer> (default: I<1260>)

The MTU of the default route pointing to the CLAT. The default is the default
IPv6 MTU used by TAYGA (1280, which in turn comes from I<RFC 6145>) minus 20 to
compensate for the difference in header size between IPv4 and IPv6. This
prevents outbound packets from having to be fragmented by TAYGA, and also
makes local applications advertise a TCP MSS to their remote peers that
prevent them from sending packets beck to us that would require fragmentation.

If you know that the IPv6 Path MTU between the host and the PLAT is larger
than 1280, you may increase this, but then you should also recompile TAYGA
with a larger B<ipv6_offlink_mtu> setting in I<conffile.c>.

=back

=head1 LIMITATIONS

B<clatd> will not be able to acquire an IPv6 address for the CLAT if SLAAC
isn't used. I<RFC 6877> suggests DHCPv6 IA_PD should be attempted in this
case, but this isn't currently implemented.

B<clatd> will not attempt to perform Duplicate Address Detection for the IPv6
address it generates. This is a violation of I<RFC 6877>.

B<clatd> will not attempt to perform a connectivity check to a discovered PLAT
prefix before setting up the CLAT, as I<RFC 7050> suggest it should.
